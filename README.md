# java-lab
A collection of small apps and exercises demonstrating fundamentals and continued learning in Java.

## [media-catalog-console-app](https://github.com/betheducky/library-catalog-java)
A lightweight Java application showcasing key object-oriented programming concepts. The project uses an abstract MediaItem base class, subclass overrides, and polymorphic behavior to manage different media types (Books, Audiobooks, and Movies). A menu-driven console interface allows users to add items, search for items, and perform intuitive actions with the media items (preview, consume, download, borrow, return). Designed as an intermediate practice project.
